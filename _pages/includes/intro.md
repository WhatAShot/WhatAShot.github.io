I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Jian Wu and Prof. Danny Z. Chen (*IEEE Fellow*). My research interest focuses on dealing with representation learning, and I am trying to take a glimpse of <span style="color:SeaGreen">Part-to-Whole Learning</span> (<span style="color:SeaGreen">P2W</span>, highly related to GLOM -- glom together: part-whole hierarchy learning; Hinton, 2021) that manages to parse objects/ concepts into part-whole hierarchy for better understanding and to explore to combine parse trees with neural networks. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">P2W</span> inspired my researches on the <span style="color:#FC6A03;">discrete data processing (DD)</span>, as well as the <span style="color:RoyalBlue">deep learning architecture design (DLA-D)</span>, <span style="color:#8866FF;">computer vision processing (CV)</span>, and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI researches for Medicine (M-AI)</span>. I have published 5 first-author papers in top international AI conferences such as ICML, CVPR, and IJCAI to discuss my insights of P2W Learning. I also focused on AI for medicine and published more than 10 papers in top medical AI conferences such as MICCAI and journals such as TMI, which involves ECG data processing, medical image analyses, and examination result (represented in table format) analyses.

I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 (undergraduate) and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in *Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge - MICCAI 2019*, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in *Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge - MICCAI 2019*.

I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie Antonio O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy playing billiard, painting and reading in my leisure time.
