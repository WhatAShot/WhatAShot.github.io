Hey, I am Jintai Chen, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA. 

Before that, I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. I am boardly interested in the general areas of <span style="color:#D70761;">AI for healthcare (AI4H)</span>, with a particular focus on medical knowledge-aware machine learning algorithm design and machine learning for medical knowledge discovery. My methodological focus centers on <span style="color:SeaGreen">structured representation learning (SRL)</span>, <span style="color:#FC6A03;">tabular data (TD)</span>, and <span style="color:RoyalBlue">computer vision (CV)</span>.

<!-- I have published over 30 papers on top international AI conferences and top AI4Healthcare conferences/ journals.-->
<!-- that manages to parse objects/ concepts into part-whole hierarchy for better understanding and to explore to implant parse trees into a neural network. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span> inspired my researches on  -->

<!-- , and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span>.  -->
<!-- in top international AI conferences such as ICML, CVPR, and AAAI, -->
<!-- presenting advanced AI technologies 
and more than 10 papers in  such as MICCAI and TMI.-->
<!-- involving ECG data processing, medical image analysis, and medical examination result (represented in tables) analysis. -->
<!-- I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021, the *Huawei Fundamental Research Scholarship* in 2022. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in the Challenge of Signet Ring Cell Detection and in the Challenge of Organ-At-Risk Segmentation from Chest CT Scans, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in the Challenge of Colonoscopy Tissue Segmentation. -->

I am also an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy painting in my leisure time.
