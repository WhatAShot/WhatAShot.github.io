I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Jian Wu and Danny Z. Chen (*IEEE Fellow*, University of Notre Dame). My research interest focuses on <span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM</span> (<span style="color:SeaGreen">glom together</span>; Hinton, 2021) including the capsule representation clustering and part-whole relation searching. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM</span> presented to my considerations on the <span style="color:RoyalBlue">deep learning architecture design (DLA-D)</span>, <span style="color:#8866FF;">computer vision processing (CV)</span>, <span style="color:#FC6A03;">discrete data processing (DD)</span>, and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI for Medicine (M-AI)</span>. I have published 5 first-author papers in top international AI conferences such as ICML discussing my consideration of GLOM representation learning, and published more than 10 papers in top medical AI conferences such as MICCAI and journals such as TMI.

I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 (undergraduate) and 2021, and won the *Tencent Scholarship* in 2021. I am the core member of the our team participating MICCAI competitions and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in *Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge - MICCAI 2019*, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in *Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge - MICCAI 2019*.
