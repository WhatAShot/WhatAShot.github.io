I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Jian Wu and Danny Z. Chen (*IEEE Fellow*, University of Notre Dame). My research interest focuses on data representation learning by specific deep learning architecture, including the <span style="color:RoyalBlue">continuation of discrete data</span>, <span style="color:#8866FF;">discretization of continuous data</span>, <span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM (e.g., capsule representation clustering)</span>, <span style="color:#FC6A03;">macro-representation learning</span>, and well benefits AI research for Medicine. I have published 5 first-author papers in top international AI conferences such as ICML discussing my consideration of representation learning, and published more than 10 papers in top medical AI conferences such as MICCAI and journals such as TMI.

I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 (undergraduate) and 2021, and won the *Tencent Scholarship* in 2021. I am the core member of the our team participating MICCAI competitions and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in *Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge - MICCAI 2019*, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in *Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge - MICCAI 2019*.
