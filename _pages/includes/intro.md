I am about to become a postdoctoral researcher at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA. I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wujian) and working close with [Prof. Danny Ziyi Chen](https://www3.nd.edu/~dchen/), *IEEE Fellow*. My research interest focuses on human-compatible neural network design including <span style="color:SeaGreen">Part-Hierarchy Learning</span> (<span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span>, highly related to GLOM, Hinton, 2021) and additive neural network, as well as the applications on <span style="color:#D70761;">AI for Healthcare (AI4H)</span>,
<!-- that manages to parse objects/ concepts into part-whole hierarchy for better understanding and to explore to implant parse trees into a neural network. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span> inspired my researches on  -->
<span style="color:#FC6A03;">tabular data processing (TD)</span>, <span style="color:RoyalBlue">neural network architecture design (NN-D)</span>, and <span style="color:#8866FF;">computer vision (CV)</span>.
<!-- , and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span>.  -->
I have published over 30 papers on top international AI conferences and top AI4Healthcare conferences/ journals.
<!-- in top international AI conferences such as ICML, CVPR, and AAAI, -->
<!-- presenting advanced AI technologies 
and more than 10 papers in  such as MICCAI and TMI.-->
<!-- involving ECG data processing, medical image analysis, and medical examination result (represented in tables) analysis. -->

<!-- I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021, the *Huawei Fundamental Research Scholarship* in 2022. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in the Challenge of Signet Ring Cell Detection and in the Challenge of Organ-At-Risk Segmentation from Chest CT Scans, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in the Challenge of Colonoscopy Tissue Segmentation. -->

I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie Antonio O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy painting in my leisure time.
