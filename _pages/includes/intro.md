I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wujian) and working close with [Prof. Danny Ziyi Chen](https://www3.nd.edu/~dchen/), *IEEE Fellow*. My research interest focuses on <span style="color:#D70761;">AI for Health (AI4H)</span>, as well as <span style="color:SeaGreen">Part-Hierarchy Learning</span> (<span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span>, highly related to GLOM, Hinton, 2021), 
<!-- that manages to parse objects/ concepts into part-whole hierarchy for better understanding and to explore to implant parse trees into a neural network. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span> inspired my researches on  -->
<span style="color:#FC6A03;">tabular data processing (TD)</span>, <span style="color:RoyalBlue">neural network architecture design (NN-D)</span>, and <span style="color:#8866FF;">computer vision (CV)</span>.
<!-- , and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span>.  -->
I have published several top international AI conferences (2×ICML, 2×AAAI, 1×CVPR, 1×IJCAI) as first-author
<!-- in top international AI conferences such as ICML, CVPR, and AAAI, -->
<!-- presenting advanced AI technologies -->
and published more than 10 papers in top <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span> conferences/ journals such as MICCAI and TMI, involving ECG data processing, medical image analysis, and medical examination result (represented as structured input format) analysis.

I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 (undergraduate) and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021, the *Huawei Fundamental Research Scholarship* in 2022. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in the Challenge of Signet Ring Cell Detection and in the Challenge of Organ-At-Risk Segmentation from Chest CT Scans, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in the Challenge of Colonoscopy Tissue Segmentation.

I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie Antonio O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy painting in my leisure time.
