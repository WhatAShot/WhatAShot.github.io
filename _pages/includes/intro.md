I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wujian) and [Prof. Danny Ziyi Chen](https://www3.nd.edu/~dchen/), *IEEE Fellow*. My research interest focuses on <span style="color:#D70761;">AI for Health (AI4H)</span> and representation learning (including the practice of <span style="color:SeaGreen">Part-Hierarchy Learning</span> (<span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span>, highly related to GLOM, Hinton, 2021), 
<!-- that manages to parse objects/ concepts into part-whole hierarchy for better understanding and to explore to implant parse trees into a neural network. The insights on <span style="color:SeaGreen">PHL</span> inspired my researches on  -->
<span style="color:#FC6A03;">discrete data processing (DD)</span>, <span style="color:RoyalBlue">neural network architecture design (NN-D)</span>, and <span style="color:#8866FF;">computer vision (CV)</span>).
<!-- , and <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span>.  -->
I have published several first-author papers in top international AI conferences such as ICML, CVPR, and AAAI,
<!-- presenting advanced AI technologies -->
and published more than 10 papers in top <span style="color:#D70761;">AI4H</span> conferences/ journals such as MICCAI and TMI, which involves ECG data processing, medical image analysis, and medical examination result (represented as structured input format) analysis.

I was honored with the *National Scholarship of China* in 2015 (undergraduate) and 2021, and won the *Tencent Doctoral Scholarship* in 2021. I am the core member of our team participating MICCAI competitions, and we won <span style="color:red">the 1-st place</span> in *Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge - MICCAI 2019*, and <span style="color:red">the 2-nd place</span> in *Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge - MICCAI 2019*.

I am an amateur snooker player and a big fan of [Ronnie Antonio O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O%27Sullivan), and I also enjoy playing billiard and painting in my leisure time.
