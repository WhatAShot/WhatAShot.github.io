I am now a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University, co-supervised by Prof. Jian Wu and Danny Z. Chen (*IEEE Fellow*, University of Notre Dame). My research interest focuses on data representation learning by specific deep learning architecture, including the $\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\text{continuation of discrete data}}$, $\textcolor{BurntOrange}{\text{discretization of continuous data}}$, $\textcolor{SeaGreen}{\text{capsule}}$ $\textcolor{SeaGreen}{\text{representation}}$ $\textcolor{SeaGreen}{\text{clustering}}$, $\textcolor{Rhodamine}{\text{macro-representation learning}}$, and well benefits AI research for Medicine. I have published 5 first-authored papers in top international AI conferences such as ICML discussing my consideration of representation learning, and published more than 10 papers in top medical AI conferences such as MICCAI and journals such as TCBB and TMI.

I was honored with the *National Scholar Scholarship of China* in 2015 and 2021, and won the *Tencent Scholarship for Ph.D. Students* in 2021. I am the core member of the our team participating MICCAI competitions and we won the $1^{st}$ place in * - 2019*


the $2^{nd}$ place in *Digestive-System Pathological Detection and Segmentation Challenge - MICCAI 2019*
