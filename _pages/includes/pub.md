- **<span style="color:SeaGreen">Insights of GLOM</span>**: This work provides **a new GLOM approach**. Previous routing executes clustering by iteractive process, for flexibly aggregating parts into a whole. However, (i) clustering parts according to high-dimensional feature similarity suffers from "curse of dimension"; (ii) an iterative process hinders to build a model deeper; (iii) feature value similarity cannot be used to find semantically cooperative object parts. We separate a clustering process into severel steps of an agglomerative hierachical clustering, and in each step capsules use its receptors (templates) to select the "right" object parts in a straightforward way. We gave an important constraint that the receptors of children capsules are recombined to act as receptors of parent capsules, thus capsules in different layers execute **one** agglomerative hierachical clustering.

[A Receptor Skeleton for Capsule Neural Networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/chen21x/chen21x.pdf)[<span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM</span>, <span style="color:#8866FF;">CV</span>], **Jintai Chen**, Hongyun Yu, Chengde Qian, Danny Z. Chen, Jian Wu$$^*$$, **International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)**, 2020

- Motivated by how neuron cells work and collaborate, the proposed new capsule structure is equipped with a transmitter and several optimizable receptors, and a capsule works like a neuron cell (i.e., transmitters compress a capsule feauture (an object part) and send the compressed feature to the higher level; receptors of higher-level capsules semantically match the "right" object parts). The novel skeleton oragnizes all capsules, like a nervous system, to execute an agglomerative hierachical clustering, without iteractive process.

- **<span style="color:SeaGreen">Insights of GLOM</span>**: The consensus view of GLOM considers to represent object whole by encoding locations and representations of object parts with a general approach. In our case, an ECG view represents partial waves of whole heartbeat signal. It is a simple situation for GLOM, because the *location* for recording one ECG view (object part) is pre-given and fixed, while in a more complex situation the location relations between object parts and whole are ambiguous. In the simple setting, the proposed model, a less pure version of GLOM, generalizes well on learning whole heartbeat from sparse ECG signals. The pre-given and clear ECG viewpoints (i.e., locations) is the fundament of success in part-whole relation generalization, and the problem with more complicated location information is still open. But, the positive aspect is, the locations of detailed waveforms in one ECG view are complicated (relative to the whole heartbeat information) and well quantized by our model.

- **Academic Impact**: It is the first work that raises the concept of *Electrocardio panorama*, which allows visualizing heartbeat signals (ECG signals) from any viewpoints. Thus, our work benefits (i) Panoramic observations of heartbeat signals; (ii) Transformation among different ECG recording systems; (iii) Waveform-aligned Mixup on ECG signals for data augmentation; (iv) New multi-view ECG signal synthesis from scratch; (v) Corrupted ECG view reconstruction. <span style="color:red">(PS: this paper got scores 7, 9, 10 of 10 in the IJCAI double-blind review)</span>
- **New Data Annotations**: We provided ECG wave segmentation annotations for Tianchi ECG dataset and PTB dataset.
- **Exposure**: Our work is promoted by more than 20 media and forums, such as [æœºå™¨ä¹‹å¿ƒ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nUOQjLzE7LPCizVAZJtA6Q), [ä¸“çŸ¥](https://www.zhuanzhi.ai/document/2641de7df0eabfe36f40fd30fa33d848), [æ¾Žæ¹ƒ](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13432066), [AIç ”ä¹ ç¤¾](https://www.yanxishe.com/reportDetail/27449).

- This work provides a FCN backbone with a kind of new efficient location-aware graph convolution for 3D detection in point cloud, and predicts the 3D object centers by voting from hierarchical feature levels. It is also observed that our method is more sensitive than the official manual annotations.
- **<span style="color:SeaGreen">Insights of GLOM</span>**: Point cloud is a natural scenario to explore part-whole relation modeling. The point-wise MLP (in PointNet++) for point features agglomeration neglected the detailed location information, and we quantize the location information using only **one** scalar feature in the proposed graph convolution and obtain the performance gain over 1% mAP.

- This work raises a principle "group + abstract" for tabular learning, and explores the impacts of model depth for tabular data processing.
- **<span style="color:SeaGreen">Insights of GLOM</span>**: Tabular data is naturally discrete, and we seek for the semantic aggregation path from part to whole by an optimizable feature grouping approach. Tabular data is independent to the *position* information.
