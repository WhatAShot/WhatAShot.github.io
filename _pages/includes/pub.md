[**Project**](https://speechresearch.github.io/fastspeech/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- FastSpeech is the first fully parallel end-to-end speech synthesis model.
- **Academic Impact**: This work is included by many famous speech synthesis open-source projects, such as [ESPNet ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/espnet/espnet?style=social)](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). Our work are promoted by more than 20 media and forums, such as [Êú∫Âô®‰πãÂøÉ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UkFadiUBy-Ymn-zhJ95JcQ)„ÄÅ[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.cn/article/tvy7hnin8bjvlm6g0myu).
- **Industry Impact**: FastSpeech has been deployed in [Microsoft Azure TTS service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai/neural-text-to-speech-extends-support-to-15-more-languages-with/ba-p/1505911) and supports 49 more languages with state-of-the-art AI quality. It was also shown as a text-to-speech system acceleration example in [NVIDIA GTC2020](https://resources.nvidia.com/events/GTC2020s21420).

- **New Data Annotations**: We provided ECG wave segmentation annotations for Tianchi ECG dataset and PTB dataset.
- **Exposure**: Our work are promoted by more than 20 media and forums, such as [Êú∫Âô®‰πãÂøÉ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nUOQjLzE7LPCizVAZJtA6Q), [‰∏ìÁü•](https://www.zhuanzhi.ai/document/2641de7df0eabfe36f40fd30fa33d848), [ÊæéÊπÉ](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_13432066), [AIÁ†î‰π†Á§æ](https://www.yanxishe.com/reportDetail/27449).
- **<span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM</span> insights**: In the idea of <span style="color:SeaGreen">GLOM</span>, modeling object whole presents a general approach for position auto-encoding and representation learning of object parts. An ECG view illustrates partial ECG waves of whole heartbeat signal. It is a degeneration problem of GLOM, because the *position* for recording one ECG view (object part) is is well defined and relatively simple, while in a standard GLOM problem the definite positional relations between object parts and whole are complex and not given. In this degeneration problem, the proposed model Nef-Net generalizes well on learning the part-whole position relation and representation relation.

[Electrocardio panorama: Synthesizing new ECG views with self-supervision](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0495.pdf), **Jintai Chen**$$^+$$, Xiangshang Zheng$$^+$$, Hongyun Yu$$^+$$, Danny Z. Chen, Jian Wu$$^*$$, **International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)**, 2021, [\[**Code and Data**\]](https://github.com/WhatAShot/Electrocardio-Panorama)

- **Academic Impact**: It is the first to provide the concept of *Electrocardio panorama*, which allows visualizing the ECG signals from any viewpoints. Thus, our work benefits (i) Panoramic observations of heartbeat signals; (ii) Transformation among different ECG recording systems; (iii) Waveform-aligned Mixup on ECG signals for data augmentation; (iv) New multi-view ECG signal synthesis from scratch.
